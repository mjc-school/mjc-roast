* What is difference between `blocked` state and `waiting` state?
* How can you find thread’s state?
* How thread `sleep()` method is different from thread `wait()` method?
* Define a good strategy to terminate a thread?
* What is thread interrupt? How thread’s interrupt method is different from thread’s stop method?
* What happens if a thread is sleeping and you call interrupt on the thread?
* Does calling interrupt stops the thread immediately?
* Why you shouldn’t call thread’s `stop` and `suspend` methods?
* What are the different ways to create a thread?
* How `implementing Runnable` interface is different from `extending Thread` class?
* When should you extend Thread class?
* When should you inherit Runnable Interface?
* Between Runnable and Thread, which one is the preferred way?
* Does implementing Runnable creates a thread?
* Both Thread class and Runnable Interface have run methods, what is the difference?
* What is the difference between `Callable` and `Runnable` interface?
* What is the benefit of using Runnable over Callable?
* Can you throw checked exception from Runnable interface?
* Why Runnable and Callable interfaces are called Functional Interface?
* Which of the Interface returns result: Runnable or Callable?

* What is `user thread`? What is `main thread`?
* Can a program exit if Daemon thread is still running?
* Can a program exit if user thread is still running?
* When JVM halts exiting all running Daemon thread, does the finally block on a Daemon thread still gets a chance to execute?
* When a new thread is created; is it created as a user thread or a Daemon thread?
* What happens when no user thread is running but a Daemon thread is still running?
* What is Java main thread: a user thread or a Daemon thread?
* When you create a new thread on the main thread, what’s the type of thread created: daemon or user?
* For what type of jobs should you use Daemon thread?
* What is `Race condition`?
* What is `Immutable Object`?
* How immutable objects help preventing race condition?
* Why race condition may produce unpredictable results?
* Why immutable objects are considered safe in multi-threaded environment?
* Why should you declare immutable class as final?
* Why constructor should be the only way to create immutable object? What happens if setters are provided?
* What is `thread pool`?
* How a thread pool reduces the overhead of thread creation?
* How a thread pool helps to prevent application from hanging or crashing?
* How does thread pool enables loosely coupled design?
* What is `fixed thread pool` and how we can create it?


=== PRACTICAL TASKS: Threading

.What are various stages of thread states? Could you please draw a state diagram:
[%collapsible]
====
[source,java]

NEW
RUNNABLE
BLOCKED
WAITING
TIME-WAITING
TERMINATED

.Runnable vs Callable:

.Create simple Daemon Thread
[%collapsible]
====
[source,java]

Thread myThread = new Thread();
myThread.setDaemon(true);

.How ot create `fixed thread pool`?
[%collapsible]
====
[source,java]
----
Syntax:
public static ExecutorService newFixedThreadPool(int nThreads)
public static ExecutorService newFixedThreadPool(int nThreads, ThreadFactory threadFactory)
----
====
The `newFixedThreadPool()` method of `Executors` class creates a thread pool that reuses a fixed number of threads operating off a shared unbounded queue. At any point, at most n Threads will be active processing tasks. If additional tasks are submitted when all threads are active, they will wait in the queue until a thread is available.

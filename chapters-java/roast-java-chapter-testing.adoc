When there are multiple test cases in a JUnit class, there could be a common object or objects used by all the test cases. In this case, there could be specific functions that might be common throughout all the test cases. +

This doesn’t mean that the test objects have to be shared by all the test cases. The change to the object made in one test doesn’t have to be shared across all the tests as these tests are independent and may be executed in a different order as per their priority set. +

The holistic understanding of the term ‘Test Fixture’ is a fixed state in a code or a set of fixed steps in a code that is used as a precondition and few other sets of steps that are used as postcondition for all the tests. +

Thus, in other words, we are identifying those sets of statements that will repeat for all tests and thereby, try setting a fixed environment for our test methods to run. +

The purpose of using Test Fixture is to eliminate the duplication of the common code for all the testcases.
